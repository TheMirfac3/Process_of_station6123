使用 Siemens Process Simulate 对工作站 6, 1, 2, 3 的操作工序进行的序列仿真。最终结果已发布为HTML网页，方便进行交互式浏览和评审。

This project showcases a simulation for several stations on an automated production line. Using Siemens Tecnomatix Process Simulate, a detailed sequence simulation was conducted for the machining/assembly/robot processes at workstations 6, 1, 2, and 3. This HTML file is the final output, allowing for interactive viewing in a browser to demonstrate the process flow and for design review purposes.
